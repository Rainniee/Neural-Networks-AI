### Neural-Networks-AI
INFO 7374 Deep Neural Networks & AI

In this course, we will explore the latest developments in deep learning and cognitive computing. In the first part
ofthiscourse,wewillstartbyreviewingNeuralNetworksandstudyhowDeepLearningNeuralnetworksare
different from conventional Neural Network architectures. We will study Auto-encoders, Convolutional Neural
Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, LSTMs, GAN, Sequence to Sequence modeling and understand the stateof-the-art in hardware and software architectures facilitating Deep Learning. Projects and case studies will be
done in Keras, a popular Python package with a backend in MXNet, CNTK and Tensorflow. We will also discuss
the role of GPUs in deep learning and explore NVIDIAâ€™s deep learning libraries.

In the second part of the course, we will study Cognitive computing toolkits from Microsoft and IBM and develop
projects leveraging these APIs. We will then study the history of Question-Answer systems work on
Conversational Agents (Chatbots). Finally, we will study reinforcement learning algorithms and use the OpenAI
environment to build projects. Applications will be built using Amazon, Bluemix and Azure environments and
primarilyinPython.Thecourseisahands-oncourseandwill includepaperreviewsandenvironmentexploration.
